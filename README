A collection of scripts and configs for herbsluftwm

requires:
	herbsluftwm
	i3status ( I should change this to conky, all it's doing is getting the time)
	stalonetray
	dzen3-svn ( this is the name of the AUR package, it's the latest dzen with XMP and click support.)
  iceland font ( found in google fonts, you can change this to what ever you want in bar.sh
  awsetbg (this is only used in autostart to set the background, easily replaceable)


rename_tag
  launches a dmenu dialog where you can input a new name for
  the current tag. Keybindings are updated so that tags are 
  still accessed by number ( the 2nd tag is accessed with 2,
  the 5th by 5 regardless of the name )
  remembers names given to tags, lists them in order of last used.

reset_bindings
  fixes keybindings on reload.
  
bar.sh
  adds a clock and workspace switcher to each workspace
  adds a system tray to the first monitor
  for dzen to be clickable you must have the newest version of dzen (dzen-svn in the AUR)
  if you do now want this remove the ^ca line in ws_bar

xrandr_set_monitor.sh
  This parses xrandr output for each monitor, then makes one herb monitor for each found.

padding
  dmenu dialog to set the window padding
